This module, maybe, is stupid. It does an easy task in a very
complicated fashion.  But it seems to work.

The need for such a module arises from a problem with a real time
process; it sometimes reaches a share of cpu of 100% and no userspace
strategy has shown to be useful in killing it automagically.

So the idea: writing a kernel module that, given a pid, is able to
send a signal to it if a specific condition on the share of cpu used
by the process is met.

For the moment, sendsig will check every WAIT_TIMEOUT seconds if the
process you want to monitor has a share of cpu greater than or equal
to MAX_CPU_SHARE. If the process is in this situation for MAX_CHECK
consecutive checks, sendsig will send a SIG_TO_SEND signal to it (see
the #define's at the beginning of the code).
